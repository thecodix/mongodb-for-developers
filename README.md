## Motivation

Can a humble Relational-SQL-DB-backgroundâ„¢ developer learn how to No-SQL?

Does a brain conceived to perform JOIN operations have the capacity to adapt to a new scenario?

## But wait... Is this the right training for me?

The training purpose is (quote) 'Learn everything you need to know to get started building a MongoDB-based app'.

In the course, you will build a blogging platform, backed by MongoDB. A brief Python introduction is included.

MongoDB offers a handful of trainings aimed at different programming languages. The flavours include Java, Node.JS, .NET, a training focused on DBAs...

If you don't fit on one of those categories and want to learn about MongoDB, this is probably the training for you
