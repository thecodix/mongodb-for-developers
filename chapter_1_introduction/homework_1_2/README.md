# Homework 1_2
## Abstract
Get PyMongo installed on your computer. To prove its installed, run the program:

    python hw1-2.py

Note that you will need to get MongoDB installed and the homework dataset imported from the previous homework before attempting this problem.

This program will print a numeric answer. Please put just the 4-digit number into the box below (no spaces).

## It's all about that BSON

The goal here is to ensure pymongo has been correctly installed on the OS of your choice

The main issues you can find here are:

* __Pymongo is not installed__. Again that's the first step... Hurry up and have it installed
* __I'm running the script but the terminal is like.. frozen..__. Mongod service is not up an running. Do a sudo mongod service start
* __[Errno 111] Connection refused..__. Mongod service is not up an running. Do a sudo mongod service start.

Kudos for the choice of 'magic' to store the answer
