# Python
Python is presented through a series of small videos showing the most basic features of the language

The key points are that python is:

* Readable
* Garbage collected
* Dynamically typed

For newbies to python, probably the key point here is that python is easy to read, which I guess was one of the main reasons it was choosen for the training

Some of the videos explain on brief detail:

* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Loops
* Functions
* Exceptions

The concepts are simple enough to be understood with no prior knowledge of the language

A tiny exercise is attached to each video to help reinforce what's being explained

While for people with python background this will be trivial, it will surely help newcomers to get familiar with the syntax and logic, since both Pymongo and Bottle rely on it.
